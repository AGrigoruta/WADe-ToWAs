# ToWAs (Tourist Web Assistant)
Web Application Development 2018

# Description
Create a smart multi-device application able to provide useful tourist-related information based on knowledge bases such as LinkedGeoData and Wikidata. Take into consideration the use of proper conceptual models regarding the map-related information, car GPS integration, user needs (example: a family having small children wants a smooth itinerary including many stops versus a group of students focused on fun + roads full of surprises), internationalization (i.e. support for automated translation) and localization, plus the integration with popular social Web applications â€“ supporting actions like sharing and/or accessing photos, videos, reviews, advices, etc. The information of interest will be also provided by a SPARQL endpoint. Additional data could be accessed on EuroStat and/or various travel-related APIs.
