				<h2>Abstract</h2>
			</a>
			<p>
				ToWAs, Tourist Web Assistant, is a web application which provides relevant map-related data based on a user's profile. It 
				uses semantic-enabled data from Wikidata, LinkedGeoData, WikiVoyage and Eurostat combined together with a recommendation system
				in order to generate and display the best itinerary for the user. All of the data needed to create a user profile (user travelling
				with family, user which travels with a big group of friends, etc.) is retrieved from Facebook, and completed with a couple of forms
				from the application in case the user doesn't have enough relevant information on his account.
			</p>

				<h2>Motivation</h2>
			</a>
			<p>
				The Federal Aviation Administration Air Traffic Organization provides service to more than 43,000 flights and 2.6 million 
				airline passengers across more than 46 million square kilometers of airspace. They state that over 15,8 million of flights 
				are handled yearly, with an average of 43 thousand on a daily basis. On average an airplane has a capacity of 475 passengers,
				meaning that there are about 7.5 billion passengers yearly, and while some of them travel to go back home, a great majority
				will travel to foreign places, either be just business or leisure. It is the human nature to explore and find new exciting
				things to talk about and remember forever. Therefore every passenger travelling to a new place, will search and look for 
				landmarks, museums, restaurants, amusement parks, fancy hotels, that they will enjoy and keep in their minds for a long time.
				Instead of them planning their itineraries before going somewhere, why not have a smart assistant do that for them?
			</p>
			<p>
				The solution we propose is ToWAs, the friendly Tourist Web Assistant, which profiles the user thoroughly to create the best
				travel plan based on his personality and needs. Is the user a student going on holiday to Ibiza with his/her best friends?
				ToWAs will recommend the best night clubs and beaches from there. Is the user a father of two, travelling together with his
				family in Paris? ToWAs got their trip already planned beforehand, and marked Disneyland as the first attraction on the list.
				Our goal is to provide the best experience and create memorable events for every user that uses ToWAs for their next trip.
			</p>
			<p>
				ToWAs uses the data the user provides throughout his facebook profile and lets him/her complete with any kind of additional
				information that they consider relevant for their next trip. Afterwards, a travel plan is generated and displayed to the user. 
				Did ToWAs forget or did not consider a landmark or attraction you really wanted to go to? No worries, you can edit your travel
				plan at any time and the application will adapt to your modifications.

				<h2>Technologies</h2>
			</a>
			<p>
				For the Back-End part, we decided to use C# and .NET Core, since it's easy to configure and it provides a lot of usefull features, and we have some 
				experience with it from other University projects from the past years. We will use ASP .NET Core WebAPI for developing the RESTful
				API, and .NET RDF for the Semantic part which can handle RDF, RDFS, RDFa, OWL and SPARQL. We didn't consider necessary the use of a database because the login is being done only through Facebook API so that we can gather as much information about the user as possible. All the other data was stored just for the duration of the session because the parameters for the recommandations can change with every request from the user. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For the Front-End part, we aim for a Single Page Application (SPA), using Angular 7 as the main helping library. We will use the latest stable ECMAScript spec (ES8), and Webpack in order to optimize the build and overall
				performance of the application. As for the styling of the page, ToWAs will have Sass as the main CSS preprocessor. The map
				will be rendered using OpenLayers and retrieve relevant data about locations from OpenLayers aswell.

				<h2>Graphical Interface</h2>
			</a>
			<p>
				We opted for a Single-Page Application, which is simplifying the user experience and dynamically loading the data in order
				to focus on the offered services. When the user launches the application he will be sent to the login page, where he has a small
				description about the application and a Facebook login button, which will redirect him to a Facebook permission granting page and
				afterwards to the landing page of ToWAs.
			</p>
			<figure typeof="sa:Image">
				<img src="ToWAs login page.png">
			</figure>
			<p>
				After logging in, he will be presented with the landing page, the dashboard, setting the main focus on the map itself. The first time
				when the user logs in, the application will get his current position and try to create a general trip plan for it and display points
				of interest on the map. When he hovers over them, he will have additional data about them, including the name and a brief description. The search bar from the navbar is there for the user to search for
				a location and see what does ToWAs generate for it. On the top right he has three buttons. The first one is actually his profile picture 
				from Facebook if he has one, and if he clicks it he will have two options: to view his profile with the data he provides ToWAs with and 
				the option to logout.
			</p>
			<figure typeof="sa:Image">
				<img src="ToWAs dashboard.png">
			</figure><figure typeof="sa:Image">
				<img src="ToWAs dasboard hover.jpg">
			</figure>
			<p>
				When the user presses the third button from the navbar, a container will slide from the right, showing a list of all the locations that
				ToWAs found for him. When he clicks on any of the items, the map will have that location centered and the distances toward the other 
				locations will be calculated again based on the current item. As an addition, a route/itinerary will be generated using all of the recommended
				points of interest, using the best route from point A to point B.
			</p>
			<figure typeof="sa:Image">
				<img src="ToWAs location details and route.png">
			</figure>
			<p>
				The second button will launch a modal in which he can describe his next trip for a better recommendation the next time he enters the app.

				<h2>Data</h2>
			</a>
			<p>
				We wanted to use the data from Facebook as the main source of information for making recommandations, but unfortunately Facebook no longer gives access to fields containing personal information of the user, what he likes, where he travelled, etc because of the new GDPR laws. We are forced to gather most of our information directly from the user's input through a form and make a recommandation using that data.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for GeoData data, we will have a combination of three semantic-enabled providers: Dbpedia and Wikidata. 
				The geodata will be accessed through SPARQL endpoints provided by each API.
			</p>
		</section>

			<a name="schemaBD">
				<h2>Recommendation System</h2>
			</a>
			<p>
				A recommendation engine, also known as a recommender system, is software that analyzes available data to make suggestions
				for something that a website user might be interested in, such as a book, a video or a job, among other possibilities.
				When it comes to recommendation systems, there are three main types of algorithms worth mentioning:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Content based: if you like an item, then you will also like a similar item
				</li>
				<li>
					Collaborative: If a person A has the same interests as the person B, then the two should like the same items
				</li>
				<li>
					Hybrid: a combination between the two above mentioned types
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				For our application we are going to use a Content based approach.
				We will retrieve all the data that the user fills in our form regarding the next trip and filter exactly the relevant data, then based on
				his check-ins and likes we can then optimise our result.
			</p>
		</section>

				<h2>Implementation</h2>
			</a>
			<p>
				As we mentioned above, the first problem that we encountered was that we could no longer use Facebook API to get informations about the user because the GDPR prohibits Facebook from sharing the user's personal data with people without the permission of said user.  We still decided to use facebook API as a login mechanism. 
			</p>
			<figure typeof="sa:Image">
				<img src="ToWAs fin1.jpg">
			</figure>
			<p>


				For the GUI we used OpenLayers to render the map. Upon logging in, the user has to complete a form containing some details about himself. We will use this data to offer him recommendations for places to visit. Upon initiating a new search for places to visit in a certain town, the client application sends the backend the name of the city. Upon response, pins are placed on the map to show the location of the points of interest. The answer usually contains between 5 and 9 points of interest. The user can change his journey's filters at any time to get new recomandations, by pressing the "plus" button on the GUI. 
			</p>
			<figure typeof="sa:Image">
				<img src="ToWAs fin2.png">
			<p>	

			
				The backend API uses querys to get data from Dbpedia, Wikidata, etc using SparQL, based on the user information and locations in the city. The response is divided into categories to make it easier for the recommendation system to pick what objectives to send back to the client. The recommendation system is composed of multiple filters for each piece of data the user gave us, and tries to match his every need. 
			</p>
			<figure typeof="sa:Image">
				<img src="ToWAs fin3.jpg">

			<p>
			<figure typeof="sa:Image">
				<img src="SparQL query.jpg">

				Above we have an image of the query used to get most of our data from the endpoint. We select:
				 	-"thing" which represents our points of interest 
				 	-"abs" which respresents a brief description of the said "thing"
				 	-"type" which is used the define the type of the point of interest
				 	-"typename" is a way for us to easily group all the data we gather
				 	-"long" and "lat" are the geographical coordinates
				 	-"country" which return the name of the country the city we search for is located in.

				We fetch the city name from the client application. Afterwards, we define "thing" as a certain "type" from Dbpedia of our choosing, in this case "Hotel", "Museum", "Park" etc. We use the optional tag so that the query never return empty. At the end we also filter based on "type" and the language of the abstract.


				Doing the query this way makes it easy to add new types of points of interest and it is easy to create new types of objects without writing redundant code.

			<p>

			For further development we could implement a database to record the points of interest the users were already given so that we don't repeat the recommendations.
