				<h2>Abstract</h2>
			</a>
			<p>
				ToWAs, Tourist Web Assistant, is a web application which provides relevant map-related data based on a user's profile. It 
				uses semantic-enabled data from Wikidata, LinkedGeoData, WikiVoyage and Eurostat combined together with a recommendation system
				in order to generate and display the best itinerary for the user. All of the data needed to create a user profile (user travelling
				with family, user which travels with a big group of friends, etc.) is retrieved from Facebook, and completed with a couple of forms
				from the application in case the user doesn't have enough relevant information on his account.

				<h2>Motivation</h2>
			</a>
			<p>
				The Federal Aviation Administration Air Traffic Organization provides service to more than 43,000 flights and 2.6 million 
				airline passengers across more than 46 million square kilometers of airspace. They state that over 15,8 million of flights 
				are handled yearly, with an average of 43 thousand on a daily basis. On average an airplane has a capacity of 475 passengers,
				meaning that there are about 7.5 billion passengers yearly, and while some of them travel to go back home, a great majority
				will travel to foreign places, either be just business or leisure. It is the human nature to explore and find new exciting
				things to talk about and remember forever. Therefore every passenger travelling to a new place, will search and look for 
				landmarks, museums, restaurants, amusement parks, fancy hotels, that they will enjoy and keep in their minds for a long time.
				Instead of them planning their itineraries before going somewhere, why not have a smart assistant do that for them?
			</p>
			<p>
				The solution we propose is ToWAs, the friendly Tourist Web Assistant, which profiles the user thoroughly to create the best
				travel plan based on his personality and needs. Is the user a student going on holiday to Ibiza with his/her best friends?
				ToWAs will recommend the best night clubs and beaches from there. Is the user a father of two, travelling together with his
				family in Paris? ToWAs got their trip already planned beforehand, and marked Disneyland as the first attraction on the list.
				Our goal is to provide the best experience and create memorable events for every user that uses ToWAs for their next trip.
			</p>
			<p>
				ToWAs uses the data the user provides throughout his facebook profile and lets him/her complete with any kind of additional
				information that they consider relevant for their next trip. Afterwards, a travel plan is generated and displayed to the user. 
				Did ToWAs forget or did not consider a landmark or attraction you really wanted to go to? No worries, you can edit your travel
				plan at any time and the application will adapt to your modifications.

				<h2>Technologies</h2>
			</a>
			<p>
				For the Back-End part, we decided to use Java EE using Spring Boot, since it's easy to configure, and we have some 
				experience with it from other University projects from the past years. We will use Jersey for developing the RESTful
				API, and Apache Jena for the Semantic part which can handle RDF, RDFS, RDFa, OWL and SPARQL. As for the database, we opted
				for a NoSQL db, using MongoDB since it's lightweight, having easy to access and edit records, in which we will store mostly 
				user data.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the Front-End part, we aim for a Single Page Application (SPA), using React as the main helping library, but we
				will not abuse it and also have plain JavaScript code snippets for the native performance boost and get rid of redundant
				boilerplating. We will use the latest stable ECMAScript spec (ES8), and Webpack in order to optimize the build and overall
				performance of the application. As for the styling of the page, ToWAs will have Sass as the main CSS preprocessor. The map
				will be rendered using OpenLayers and retrieve relevant data about locations from Google Maps API.

				<h2>Graphical Interface</h2>
			</a>
			<p>
				We opted for a Single-Page Application, which is simplifying the user experience and dynamically loading the data in order
				to focus on the offered services. When the user launches the application he will be sent to the login page, where he has a small
				description about the application and a Facebook login button, which will redirect him to a Facebook permission granting page and
				afterwards to the landing page of ToWAs
			</p>
			<figure typeof="sa:Image">
				<img src="ToWAs login page.png">
			</figure>
			<p>
				After logging in, he will be presented with the landing page, the dashboard, setting the main focus on the map itself. The first time
				when the user logs in, the application will get his current position and try to create a general trip plan for it and display points
				of interest on the map. When he hovers over them, he will have additional data about them, including how many of his Facebook friends
				have been there and he will be able to see their pictures as well. The search bar from the navbar is there for the user to search for
				a location and see what does ToWAs generate for it. On the top right he has three buttons. The first one is actually his profile picture 
				from Facebook if he has one, and if he clicks it he will have two options: to view his profile with the data he provides ToWAs with and 
				the option to logout.
			</p>
			<figure typeof="sa:Image">
				<img src="ToWAs dashboard.png">
			</figure><figure typeof="sa:Image">
				<img src="ToWAs dasboard hover.jpg">
			</figure>
			<p>
				When the user presses the third button from the navbar, a container will slide from the right, showing a list of all the locations that
				ToWAs found for him. When he clicks on any of the items, the map will have that location centered and the distances toward the other 
				locations will be calculated again based on the current item. As an addition, a route/itinerary will be generated using all of the recommended
				points of interest, using the best route from point A to point B.
			</p>
			<figure typeof="sa:Image">
				<img src="ToWAs location details and route.png">
			</figure>
			<p>
				The second button will launch a modal in which he can describe his next trip for a better recommendation the next time he enters the app.

				<h2>Data</h2>
			</a>
			<p>
				The main data we will use is retrieved from Facebook, using their Graph API, and more precisely, we will check the user's basic
				information (age, gender, relationship, etc.), user likes, user friends extended to their check-ins and photos from there. The 
				user data will be completed using our own forms, just in case the user does not have too many details projected on Facebook, in
				order to create a better profiling.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for GeoData data, we will have a combination of three semantic-enabled providers: LinkedGeoData, WikiVoyage and Wikidata. To 
				follow the traveller trends all over Europe, we will make use of Eurostat's statistics and comply our recommendations based on that.
				The geodata will be accessed through SPARQL endpoints provided by each API.
			</p>

				<h2>Recommendation System</h2>
			</a>
			<p>
				A recommendation engine, also known as a recommender system, is software that analyzes available data to make suggestions
				for something that a website user might be interested in, such as a book, a video or a job, among other possibilities.
				When it comes to recommendation systems, there are three main types of algorithms worth mentioning:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Content based: if you like an item, then you will also like a similar item
				</li>
				<li>
					Collaborative: If a person A has the same interests as the person B, then the two should like the same items
				</li>
				<li>
					Hybrid: a combination between the two above mentioned types
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				For our application we are going to use a Hybrid approach, combining both content based recommendation and collaborative recommendation.
				We will retrieve all the data that the user fills in our form regarding the next trip and filter exactly the relevant data, then based on
				his check-ins and likes we can then optimise our result. The collaborative part requires the user's friend data, their check-ins, their 
				interests and recommend locations and points of interest based on that.
